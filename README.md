# Eve + MongoDB REST API

## Because why?

I'm playing around with various recipes for standing up simple REST APIs and getting more familiar with Docker and other tools in the process.

## What it is

* [Docker Python image](https://hub.docker.com/r/grahamdumpleton/mod-wsgi-docker/)
* WSGI config script
* Dockerfile that installs Eve, a simple API, and sets the WSGI start point

## To do

* Update README.md to explain each file
